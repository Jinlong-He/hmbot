You need to determine whether the page transition is correct.
I will give you three images: the first is the page before event execution (before), the second is the expected page after PTG event execution (after), and the third is the page obtained after actual event execution (actual after).

**Verification Priority:**
1. **First determine if the operation is effective**: Compare the first image (before) and the third image (actual after). If there is no change in the interface, it means the operation did not take effect, return no_change
2. **Then determine if the transition is correct**: If the operation has taken effect, compare the second image (PTG after) and the third image (actual after) to determine whether it has transitioned to the correct interface

**Judgment Criteria:**
- **Operation effectiveness judgment**: Whether the overall layout and structure of the interface have changed
- **Interface matching judgment**: Only focus on whether the interface structure is the same, whether it is the same interface in the software
- No need to consider whether the content is completely the same, text, numbers, time, images and other specific content can be different
- As long as it is the same functional interface in the software (such as: the same settings page, the same list page, the same detail page, etc.), it is considered a match

Please return the results strictly in the following JSON format:

{
  "think": "Brief analysis: first determine if the operation is effective (1vs3), then determine if the interface matches (2vs3)",
  "result": true/false,
  "error_type": "no_change/wrong_page/null"
}

Where:
- think: Brief analysis process, analyzed according to verification priority
- result: Boolean value, true means the operation is effective and transitions to the correct interface, false means there is a problem
- error_type: Error category, fill in when result is false:
  - "no_change": The operation did not take effect (the first and third images are basically the same)
  - "wrong_page": The operation took effect but transitioned to the wrong interface (the first and third images are different, but the second and third images do not match)
  - "null": Fill in null when result is true

Please ensure that the returned result is in valid JSON format."""

I need you to analyze screenshots before and after operations and generate corresponding operation descriptions.

I will give you two images:
First image: Interface screenshot before operation (before)
Second image: Interface screenshot after operation (after)

Please analyze the differences between these two screenshots, infer what operations might have been performed from the first screenshot to the second screenshot, and generate specific operation descriptions.

When analyzing, please consider:
- Interface layout changes (page transitions, popup appearance/disappearance, etc.)
- Element state changes (button highlighting, text changes, switch states, etc.)
- Content changes (list item increase/decrease, input box content, etc.)
- Scroll position changes
- Focus or selection state changes

Please generate accurate operation descriptions in the following format in Chinese:
- 点击[具体位置]的[具体元素]
- 向[方向]滑动
- 输入文本"[具体内容]"
- 长按[具体元素]

**Notes:**
- Do not click buttons with voice input functionality (such as microphone icons, voice buttons, etc.)
- Prioritize text buttons or icon buttons for operations

Please provide concise and clear operation descriptions in Chinese."""

generate_return_operation_prompt = """You are a professional mobile UI automation testing expert.
I need you to analyze screenshots and PTG operation information to help the phone return from the current page to the target page.

I will give you the following information:
1. Two images:
   - First image: Target page (the page we want to return to, which is the page before the action is executed)
   - Second image: Current page (the page where the phone is now, the page after the action is executed, need to return to the target page from here)
2. Operation event information executed between PTG two nodes

Please comprehensively analyze these two screenshots and PTG operation events, and directly give a specific operation description to enable the phone to return from the current page to the target page.

When analyzing, please consider:
- What operations were performed between PTG nodes (click, swipe, input, etc.)
- What page transitions or state changes this operation might have caused
- Infer the most appropriate return method based on the operation type

For example:
- 点击左上角的返回按钮
- 点击底部导航栏的首页按钮
- 向右滑动返回上一页
- 点击顶部的关闭按钮
- 按系统返回键

Please provide concise and clear operation descriptions in Chinese."""
